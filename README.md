# CloudFoundry On Azure
Microsoft has done a lot of work within the community, and with Pivotal to make sure Cloud Foundry is well served by the Azure platform.

There are a few options to deploy Cloud Foundry on Azure, one is by using the Pivotal distribution from the Azure Marketplace, or deploying Pivotal manually for a target architecture of your choosing.  The alternative to the Pivotal distribution is to use the vanilla Open Source CloudFoundry distribution, and this is what will be documented here.

## Creating your Service Principle
Creating an RBAC Service Principle is needed to be able to deploy infrastructure within Azure in a progremmatic way.

```
➜  CloudFoundryOnAzure (master) ✗ az ad sp create-for-rbac -o json
{
  "appId": "897a062d-[snip]-7a738194055c",
  "displayName": "azure-cli-2017-11-20-15-48-05",
  "name": "http://azure-cli-2017-11-20-15-48-05",
  "password": "3fe1ea97-[snip]-cfd6500aba9d",
  "tenant": "72f988bf-[snip]-2d7cd011db47"
}
```

## Deploying Bosh on Azure
The [Azure Quickstart templates](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-azure-cpi-release/blob/master/docs/guidance.md) are a great starter for deploying architectures onto Azure.  The community has also put together one specifically to get a Bosh environment up and running to be able to deploy your CloudFoundry instance.

Goto [bosh-setup](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-azure-cpi-release/blob/master/docs/get-started/via-arm-templates/deploy-bosh-via-arm-templates.md), where you will find the ARM template, as well as the scripts and metadata used to deploy a new Bosh environment.  You can click on the "Deploy to Azure" button, or can carry out an *az* cli deployment.

I like the CLI, so let's use that one.

### Create BOSH resource group
To be able to deploy most things in Azure, we need to create a resource group.  Let's go ahead and do this in the UK South region:

```
➜  CloudFoundryOnAzure (master) ✗ az group create -n bosh-juda -l uksouth
Location    Name
----------  ---------
uksouth     bosh-juda
```

### Deploy BOSH template
The *az* cli has the ability to be able to deploy an ARM template locally (using the --template-file parameter), or remotely (using the --template-url parameter).  As I don't want to clone the entire quickstart repository, let's go ahead and deploy remotely:

```
➜  GitHub az group deployment create --name bosh -g bosh-juda --template-uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/bosh-setup/azuredeploy.json
Please provide string value for 'vmName' (? for help): bosh
Please provide string value for 'adminUsername' (? for help): justin
Please provide string value for 'sshKeyData' (? for help): ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1y...[snip]...CoLQGdBKJQ2dgUwpH5ArT87FPgZ9ex justin@MININT-SK0C811
Please provide string value for 'environment' (? for help):
 [1] AzureCloud
 [2] AzureChinaCloud
 [3] AzureUSGovernment
 [4] AzureGermanCloud
 [5] AzureStack
Please enter a choice [1]: 1
Please provide string value for 'tenantID' (? for help): 72f988bf-[snip]-2d7cd011db47
Please provide string value for 'clientID' (? for help): 897a062d-[snip]-7a738194055c
Please provide securestring value for 'clientSecret' (? for help):
```

**Note** that we used the Service Principle we generated earlier in this walkthrough.

The process will take about 30 minutes, as the template will automatically deploy the Bosh environment as well as the instance resources.

Time for a :coffee: - or if you want to see what's happening, wait 5 minutes and see what the IP address of the BOSH server is:

```
➜  CloudFoundryOnAzure (master) ✗ az vm list-ip-addresses -n bosh -g bosh-juda
VirtualMachine    PublicIPAddresses    PrivateIPAddresses
----------------  -------------------  --------------------
bosh              51.140.117.59        10.0.0.100
```

SSH into the machine, and tail the bosh install log:

```
➜  CloudFoundryOnAzure (master) ✗ ssh 51.140.117.59

## Deploy Cloud Foundry
Once the BOSH environment has been deployed, ssh into the machine and take a look around.

```
➜  CloudFoundryOnAzure (master) ✗ ssh 51.140.117.59

```
justin@bosh:~$ ./deploy_cloud_foundry.sh

```

It's :coffee: time again, as this process will take between 30-40 minutes.


Finally, you should see the deployment complete.

```

## Test the deployment
The *cf* commnad line has already been installed in the bosh server, but you can also install it on your local machine.

# Setup OMS Logging for Cloud Foundry
Operation Management Suite is a number of Azure applications that helps with the monitoring and alerting of your Azure estate.  We have released an OMS dashboard specifically designed to ingest Cloud Foundry application, and Cloud Controller statistics that will help with monitoring and analysis of what your environment is doing.

## Create a Log Analytics workspace
Login to the portal, and create a new Log Analytics workspace.

![alt text](log_analytics.gif "New Workspace")

### Get the Workspace ID and Key
![alt text](oms_key.gif "New Workspace")

## Install UAAC
[UAA](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa) is Cloud Foundry's identity management service, and the way to interact with it is via the *uaac* cli.

On the BOSH VM, install the uaac client

```
sudo gem install public_suffix -v 2.0.5
sudo gem install cf-uaac
```

### Set UAA target
```
justin@bosh:~/meta-azure-service-broker$ uaac target https://uaa.51.140.108.130.xip.io --skip-ssl-validation

Target: https://uaa.51.140.108.130.xip.io
```

### Get CloudFoundry admin secret
To find the admin secret, grep the manifest file used to deploy the Cloud Foundry installation

```
justin@bosh:~$ grep client_secret example_manifests/multiple-vm-cf.yml
        client_secret: 2qwKlm8d7w4ulX4np9JJQ
        client_secret: 2qwKlm8d7w4ulX4np9JJQ
      client_secret: urqDshr[snip]bWWiBOg
      client_secret: 68oxKrR1QShjJTMGpmdg
```

The secret in question is the third in the list (you can check this by loading the manifest, and you will see the YAML treet defining the UAA -> Admin -> Secret)

### Get token from UAA
```
justin@bosh:~$ uaac token client get admin
Client secret:  *********************

Successfully fetched token via client credentials grant.
Target: https://uaa.51.140.108.130.xip.io
Context: admin, from client admin
```

### Create firehose user
```
justin@bosh:~$ cf create-user firehose FireHosePassword!
Creating user firehose...
OK

TIP: Assign roles with 'cf set-org-role' and 'cf set-space-role'.
```

### Add Firehose user to the Admin and Doppler groups
```
justin@bosh:~$ uaac member add cloud_controller.admin firehose
success
justin@bosh:~$ uaac member add doppler.firehose firehose
success
```

## Install OMS Firehose

## Configure OMS Workspace
The final part to consuming the messages from the Cloud Foundry installation is the import the Dashboard definitions.

Clone the OMS Nozzle from Github to your local machine, as this is where the definitions are also stored
